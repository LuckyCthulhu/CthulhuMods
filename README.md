# CthulhuMods

You can copy and paste the contents of the file in this repository and use it to overwrite your local modlist.txt file. Your local modlist.txt file is in the following folder: <path_to_Steam>\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox\Mods\modlist.txt

If you set this up correctly, Conan will have a slightly longer load time on the initial launch, then it will load directly into our server after you join it. (No more mod-mismatch/game restarting)

Step 1
1. Locate your modlist folder and check where your Steam folder is located. In my case, it is F:\Steam
<path_to_Steam>\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox\Mods\modlist.txt
     (You can also do this by going to your steam app library and right clicking conan exiles > properties > local files > browse local files > conan sandbox > mod             folder
     If you do not have a mod folder in ConanSandbox just create one. Then make a notepad txt file and copy and paste the list provided in to the txt file and save it.) 
2. Open the modlist file we have provided here at github.
3. Copy the contents into your modlist.txt file in the Mods folder and save.
